<!-- What is promises

  In programming, a promise is an abstraction that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Asynchronous operations are tasks that do not block the program's execution and typically involve tasks like fetching data from a server, reading a file, or performing other time-consuming tasks.

Promises are used to handle asynchronous code in a more structured and readable way. They provide a way to write asynchronous code that resembles synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

A promise has three states:

Pending: This is the initial state when the promise is created. It represents that the asynchronous operation is still ongoing and has not yet completed or failed.

Fulfilled (Resolved): The promise transitions to this state when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed. This is when the desired result or value is available.

Rejected: The promise transitions to this state if the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails for some reason.
